# string in python is of type str which is a homogeneous (of the same type!) immutable sequence of unicode codepoints (characters)

print(len('hello dragonfly close!')) # length of string

s = "hello"
s += " world" # using too much += will cause memory issue as strings are immutable!

# using join() on str is more memory efficient to join a list of large number of strings together

print(sentence)

print(splits)

# partition returns a tuple of 3 parts of the string: prefix, separator, suffix; using _ as a dummy variable 
origin, _, destination = "Zhuanghe-London".partition('-')

# format function on str
print("The age of {0} is {1}".format('Rita', 26))
